# üç≥ MagicFridgeAI

MagicFridgeAI is a backend application built with Spring Boot that transforms your fridge's ingredient list into
complete, humorous recipes, complete with an AI-generated image of the dish.

The application allows you to manage a list of food items and, with a single command, requests the OpenAI API to create
a recipe using only the available ingredients. It then generates a corresponding image for the created recipe.

## ‚ú® Features

* **Ingredient Management**: Full CRUD operations to add, list, update, and remove food items from your inventory.
* **AI-Powered Recipe Generation**: Uses OpenAI's `gpt-4.1` model to create recipes from available ingredients. The
  instructions are generated with a touch of humor, as if written by a renowned chef.
* **AI-Powered Image Generation**: After creating the recipe, the application uses the `dall-e-3` model to generate a
  realistic image of the finished dish.
* **RESTful API**: Well-defined endpoints to interact with the system, whether for managing ingredients or generating a
  new recipe.
* **Database Migration**: Uses Flyway to manage the database schema evolution automatically and in a versioned manner.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

* **Backend**: Java 21 & Spring Boot 3.5.0
* **Data Access**: Spring Data JPA
* **Database**: H2 (runtime scope), with schema managed by Flyway.
* **Reactive Communication**: Spring WebFlux `WebClient` for making calls to the OpenAI API.
* **Artificial Intelligence**:
    * Text: OpenAI `gpt-4.1`
    * Image: OpenAI `dall-e-3`
* **Build**: Apache Maven
* **Utilities**: Lombok
